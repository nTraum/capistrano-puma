    require 'capistrano/puma/monit' #if you need the monit tasks
```


Configurable options, shown here with defaults: Please note the configuration options below are not required unless you are trying to override a default setting, for instance if you are deploying on a host on which you do not have sudo or root privileges and you need to restrict the path. These settings go in the deploy.rb file. 

```ruby
    set :puma_rackup, -> { File.join(current_path, 'config.ru') }
    set :puma_state, "#{shared_path}/tmp/pids/puma.state"
    set :puma_pid, "#{shared_path}/tmp/pids/puma.pid"
    set :puma_bind, "unix://#{shared_path}/tmp/sockets/puma.sock"
    set :puma_conf, "#{shared_path}/puma.rb"
    set :puma_access_log, "#{shared_path}/log/puma_error.log"
    set :puma_error_log, "#{shared_path}/log/puma_access.log"
    set :puma_role, :app
    set :puma_env, fetch(:rack_env, fetch(:rails_env, 'production'))
    set :puma_threads, [0, 16]
    set :puma_workers, 0
    set :puma_init_active_record, false
    set :puma_preload_app, true
```
For Jungle tasks (beta), these options exist:
```ruby
    set :puma_jungle_conf, '/etc/puma.conf'
    set :puma_run_path, '/usr/local/bin/run-puma'
```
Ensure that the following directories are shared (via ``linked_dirs``):

    tmp/pids tmp/sockets log
